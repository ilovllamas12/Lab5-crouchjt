1) TDD is the process of swapping between writing tests and writing
code. This orientes the code to follow the tests.

2) Yes, the idea behind is very logical because this makes the code follow
exactly what the tests want it to do. Passing all of the tests would increase a programmers
confidence in his code and make debugging easier.

3) TDD is very tedious and sometimes too careful that it can be a waste of time. But on the same
subject sometimes sacraficing time to make sure no bugs will be found in the final code
is very important depending on the project. TDD is a unique way to develope code that
can be seen as very good or very bad depending on the preference of the programmer.
